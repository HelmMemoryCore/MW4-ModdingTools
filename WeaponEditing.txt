File: weaponsubsystems\<class>\<weapon>.data{GameModel}
Purpose: functional parameters of the weapon.
Size: 0x78 to 0xA4 depending on the weapon class.
Content: see Wep.txt
 00 ?: Always 00 00 00 00
 04 ?: Unknown, seems garbage.
 08 ?: Unknown, seems garbage.
 0C I: Weapon class, the structure size is dependent on this value:
 Class Size Description
 52040000 0x7C Lasers, instant hit weapons class.
 6E040000 0x98 Direct fire weapons (AC,UAC,Gauss,PPC,MGUN etc).
 74040000 0x9C SRM, it seems that the lock field is screwed in
 this class, missiles fly in the wrong direction
 when locked.
 75040000 0x9C MRM, flat path, the lock field allows for LRM-like
 lock.
 76040000 0x9C LRM, arc path, allows lock.
 77040000 0x9C SSRM, SMRM, flat path, instant lock.
 83040000 0x98 NARC, handles the NARC behavior.
 8F040000 0x98 Flare, handles the Flare behavior.
 97040000 0x9C SRM Bomb, unused in the game, unknown behavior.
 9E040000 0x9C LongTom, arc path, lot of bugs.
 A0040000 0x98 Flamer, what different from other direct fire
 weapons ?
 A4040000 0x98 Artillery Beacon, handles the delayed damage.
 C1040000 0xA0 LBX, handles the damage reduction over distance.
 CE040000 0xA4 RTX, handles the weapon jamming/unjamming.
 D0040000 0x9C Arrows, flat path, lock, no visible LAMS effect
 (but it seems to work, may be it would be better
 to use the SMRM class for Arrows).
 5:17:27 PM: received this ?
 5:18:05 PM: yes
 5:18:07 PM: 10 X: Null reference, FF FF 00 00.
 14 X: Reference to:
 weaponsubsystems\<class>\<weapon>.data{Element}
 18 ?: UNKNOWN, always 00 00 00 00.
 1C F: Weapon weight including the base ton of ammo (if not energy).
 20 I: It seems proportional to the damage (it is not the knock).
 Documented as "Battle Value".
 24 I: Weapon price, only important in single player and c-bills limited
 games.
 28 I: Number of slots (check if zero works).
 2C I: Weapon Group (0=Missile, 1=Projectile, 2=Energy).
 30 I: Weapon ID.
 34 X: Flare effect, reference to:
 effects\<class>\<weapon>_flare.data
 38 X: Shell ejection effect, reference to:
 effects\shell_ejection\<file>.data
 3C F: Heat generared by the weapon divided by two.
 40 F: UNKNOWN, it seems to be always 3.
 Documented as "Heat Spread Time".
 44 I: Ammo_per_ton * 3 * @28 (it is a function of the number of slots).
 5:18:12 PM: append this
48 I: Number of salvos, how many times the weapon fires.
 4C I: Ammo usage, how many ammunitions the weapon uses for each salvo.
 50 F: Heat to target divided by two.
 54 F: Weapon damage for each salvo.
 58 F: Range in meters.
 5C F: Blast radius/spread factor.
 60 F: Splash attenuation, it is related to splash damage, lower values
 mean better splash in the defined area.
 64 F: UNKNOWN, always 0.05.
 68 F: UNKNOWN, always 0.15.
 6C F: Recycle time in seconds.
 70 F: Light Amp Flare Out (0.5 SRM/SSRM/Narc/Flare, 1 MRM/LRM, 0.9 Flamer,
 0.3 Arty, 0.8 Arrows, 0 other).
 74 F: Beam duration for lasers.
 Time between salvos for other weapon classes.
 78 F: For lasers only, reference to:
 weapons\<class>\<weapon>.data{GameModel}
 For Long Tom contains 100 but unknown.
 For others always 0.
 5:18:34 PM: 7C F: For missiles:
 LT 100, 0 others.
 80 F: Projectile speed, I think it is meters/seconds.
 For missiles it is the ejection speed of the missiles from the launcher
 before the engine ignites.
 84 F: ???
 88 F: Gravity accelleration for LongTom (-9.8), it does not work for other
 weapons.
 8C F: UNKNOWN, 100 LRM/SRM, 120 MRM, 40 Arrows, 0 SSRM/SMRM, 0 others.
 90 X: Reference to:
 weapons\<class>\<weapon>.data
 94 F: Lock time in seconds for MRM, LRM, Arrows, SRM, SSRM, SMRM, it does 
not work correctly for SRM class. Unused on other weapon classes
 (always 00 00 00 00).
 98 F: Missiles: Engine Burn Time, zero disables the engine and the missile
 follows a ballistic trajectory.
 LBX, disipation start.
 RTX, time to potential jam.
 9C F: UNKNOWN but.
 LBX, max disipation.
 RTX, time to jam.
 A0 F: UNKNOWN but:
 RTX, time to unjam.
 5:18:54 PM: this is what i know about the weapon gamemodel, it is most of it but not all
 5:19:12 PM: may be you will discover some more

5-27-06 My research:

A weapon with splash size of 3, splash factor .75, weapon damage of 12 => good point damage and about 1 point of armor damage to the remainder of the mech.

 34 X: Flare effect, reference to:
 effects\<class>\<weapon>_flare.data
This so far appears only to be a pointer to the "SOUND" of the weappon when it is shot.
