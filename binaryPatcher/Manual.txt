Info file description

Info file is a json file which describes data places for modification.

Info file describes set of parameter families. Each family has some stats and regular expression to filter family files. This is a java Regex.
In described example there is "binaryInfo1" family which is described by ".*_bin.data" regex. It means that file "data/bank/table_bin.data" is in family and "data/bank/table_bin.png" is not in family.
Stats is a set of parameters. Each parameter has name, start position and type. Start position is a starting byte in binary file. There are three types possible Float, Byte and Int
