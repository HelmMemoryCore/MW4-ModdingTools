      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>Ok, for those that do not know, I am a member of the Clash of Steel modeling 
        team. I have gotten a lot of tips from everyone at the project. I think 
        I have come a long way in less than 3 months - From zero experience to 
        having a 'Mech in game. My goal in writing this is not to tell you exactly 
        how to make a 'Mech for HC nor is it to teach you how to use a 3D program. 
        My goal is to help people learn the unique things that are required for 
        a MW4:Mercs 'Mech.<br>
      </p>
      <h5>The Basics</h5>
      <p>What do you technically need?<br>
        <br>
        Before you can make a 'Mech for the game you obviously need some guidelines. 
        Here they are:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A 3000 polygon limit. This means 3000 triangles or less. This is not 
          a hard limit. For example, 3030 will be fine. The goal should never 
          be to use all the polys you can. If you can do it with 2000, go right 
          ahead.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Poseable Model. This means that the arms have to be able to swing 
          and the legs have to be able to move without hitting some other part 
          of the 'Mech.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Workable joints. Where the leg meets the foot, you should see some 
          sort of joint. Same goes for knees, arms, etc. Just play Mercs and look 
          at how the 'Mechs move.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>512x512 Texture with an alpha channel. The alpha should allow the 
          game skins to show through. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dev Team Note: </strong>Separate the 'Mech into several pieces. 
          Below is a standard list of pieces the 'Mech should be separated into. 
          Also note that each of these pieces (meshes) can only have 256 points. 
          Try to optimize your low-poly model (i.e., tubes should be octagonal).<br>
          <br>
          A 'Mech is composed by: <br>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Torso</li>
            <li>Hip</li>
            <li>Left Upper Arm</li>
            <li>Left Gun</li>
            <li>Right Upper Arm</li>
            <li>Right Gun</li>
            <li>Left Upper Leg</li>
            <li>Left Lower Leg</li>
            <li>Left Foot</li>
            <li>Left Toes (Ranges from 1 to 4)</li>
            <li>Right Upper Leg</li>
            <li>Right Lower Leg</li>
            <li>Right Foot</li>
            <li>Right Toes (Ranges from 1 to 4)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some 'Mechs can have a third leg (i.e., Argus/Thanatos/Novacat): 
            <br>
            <br>
          </p><ul>
            <li>Left Middle Leg</li>
            <li>Right Middle Leg 
              <p></p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some 'Mechs can have one or two special sections linked to any of 
            the 'Mech sections. The special section can be protection-based, such 
            as the Black Knight's arm shield, or a weapons section, like the TimberWolf's 
            missile launchers. <br>
            <br>
          </p><ul>
            <li>Specialone</li>
            <li>Specialtwo 
              <p></p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each piece must have a functional joint and they also must move in 
            any direction so they must have a spherical joint. <br>
            <br>
          </p><ul>
            <li>The torso must have a little degree to move in any direction from 
              the hip.</li>
            <li>Upper arms must float a little in a front-back direction with 
              Torso and Guns. 
              <p></p>
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li></ul>
      <h5>The Process: The Way I Make 'Em</h5>
      <p>All the tools I use are freeware or something we all have: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wings 3D. I do all my modeling in wings.</li>
        <li>Blender &amp; Yaf-Ray. I use these to render. (Yaf-Ray is a Blender 
          plugin)</li>
        <li>UV mapper. May be useful for UV'ing a 'Mech. Wings can UV too, though. 
          Both have strong points and weak points.</li>
        <li>The Gimp. Excellent free image software. For those who do not want 
          to buy Photoshop or another professional graphic editing program. 
        </li><li>TGATool2. Simple but useful tool. Lets you edit the alpha texture 
          of a TGA separately from the main RGB channels.</li>
        <li>MS Paint.</li>
      </ul>
      <div align="center"><img src="model_tutorial_files/styleline.gif" height="9" width="400"> </div>
      <h4>Step 1: Making the model</h4>
      <p>I use Wings 3D. I create a low poly first and then create a high poly. 
        So make your low poly now. Keep it under or around 3000 polys please. 
        Get a good TRO picture to work off of. Ask Gohan if you can not find them. 
        There are plenty of guides for using Wings 3D so all you have to do is 
        look around. Remember, you are an artist now, therefore you are allowed 
        to fix "ugly" parts of the 'Mech. I took quite a bit of liberty on the 
        head of the Stiletto, for example. I even added fins to the arms to tie 
        the model together better. Also, try to keep Mercs' "style". Long pointy 
        fingers are not going to fit in with the other 'Mechs.<br>
        <br>
        I am just going to show you the pictures now:<br>
        <br>

        My Low Poly Version<br>

      </center>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="model_tutorial_files/styleline.gif" height="9" width="400"> </div>
      <h4>Step 2: Adding Details &amp; Rendering</h4>
      <p>Ok, after you like your low poly, try and make sure to have others critique 
        it. Once you hammer out things that you may have missed start adding details. 
        This is your high ploy. Render these for use on the texture. Take these 
        renders and touch them up as needed.<br>
        <br>
        Here is an example - the shoulder gun on the Pack Hunter:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <center>
        <img src="model_tutorial_files/004.jpg" height="186" width="832"> 
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
        You are going have to make a lot of these. Make sure to render them at 
        an excessive size. They will look better when shrunken down. Toy with 
        the settings on your rendering program until you get something that you 
        think will look nice as a texture. I actually make two renders and combine 
        them. One is used to simulate daylight lighting from above and the other 
        has no lights but is set to show off details better. That is how I got 
        the nice inset looking shading in the smaller details on the above image. 
        <br>
        <br>
        After you get a bunch made, scale them down and place them in a 512x512 
        texture. It is good practice to place the pieces from the upper 'Mech 
        on top because many game textures have different colors from top to bottom 
        (i.e., Most OPS. Skins). Also, try to keep the pieces upright as this 
        will ensure textures with directional lines (like Deep Woods) look right.<br>
        <br>
        Here is a picture for you all. It was actually rendered at twice this 
        size with Anti-Aliasing off. I shrunk it so it would fit on this page:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <center>
        <img src="model_tutorial_files/005.jpg" height="512" width="512"> 
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
        Notice the green arrows. Those things are not from any renders. Things 
        like that can be useful for certain 'Mech parts (Wires, places you can 
        not render, some joints, etc.). </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="model_tutorial_files/styleline.gif" height="9" width="400"> </div>
      <h4>Step 3: UV Mapping</h4>
      <p>I am not going to go into detail here because there are plenty of guides. 
        I am just going give you an overview of the Fireslave way.<br>
        <br>
        Do each part separately. Make the leg be one file and the arm another. 
        You can stick them together later on. It is easier anyways to just do 
        one leg then flip it.<br>
        <br>
        I recommend starting with UV Mapper. It can map from the axis so do just 
        that. It will not be perfect but we can tweak it in Wings3D.<br>
        <br>
        Start Wings3D and you will see when you try an move the UV onto the texture 
        that UV Mapper did not do exactly what you wanted. Find the faces that 
        are messed up and select them with the face tool. Then, hit UV Mapping. 
        I am not going to explain the process here since there are Wings3D guides 
        for that.<br>
        <br>
        Anyways, eventually you will have placed all the UV pieces on top of all 
        the correct pieces of texture. Your 'Mech should look like this only it 
        better not be a Pack Hunter. ;-)<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <center>
        <img src="model_tutorial_files/006.jpg" height="629" width="505"> 
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
        Notice all the <b>black edges</b> on the model? Notice the "zipper" on 
        the head (lol)? If you did it right, you will have just little bits of 
        black on the edges. That mean you lined it up nicely and you can give 
        yourself a "Good job!" sticker. </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="model_tutorial_files/styleline.gif" height="9" width="400"> </div>
      <h4>Step 4: Ditch Those Ugly Edges</h4>
      <p>This is where MS Paint comes in handy. Use a boring Pixely paintbrush 
        to paint over the edges. You are confused, I see. Make it look like this:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <center>
        <img src="model_tutorial_files/007.jpg" height="512" width="512"> 
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
        As you can see, most of the borders have been covered up. Now start up 
        Wings3D. You will see that most of the edges are gone. In some places 
        you can not paint over the edges (Look at the legs. The edges are on the 
        render, not between the render and the black BG). The only choice here 
        is to use Wings3D to edit the UV map just a bit. Move the affected areas 
        inward a bit away from the edges (we do not want black edges everywhere). 
        Here is the edgeless version:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <center>
        <img src="model_tutorial_files/008.jpg" height="629" width="625"> 
      </center>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="model_tutorial_files/styleline.gif" height="9" width="400"> </div>
      <h4>Step 5: Using Your Grayscale Image To Make The Alpha Channel</h4>
      <p>Ok, what you want to do now is make that grayscale map into a transparency 
        map. You can do that in your paint package as well but here is how I did 
        it: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I took the grayscale image and inverted (colors, I did not flip it 
          over) it in MS Paint. This is necessary because white is solid and black 
          is see through. We do not want a black 'Mech with white shadows...</li>
        <li>After you have it inverted, you want to save it as a .bmp.</li>
        <li>Now open it up with TGA Tool 2. You actually have to click open because 
          TGA Tool 2 will not let you just double click it in explorer.</li>
        <li>In TGA Tool 2, you will see an option called "Create Alpha Template." 
          Click it and you will see it appear in the upper right of the screen. 
          You now have an alpha channel.</li>
        <li>Double click on the main image and it will open itself up in MS Paint. 
          Just paint the whole thing black and hit save.</li>
        <li>Now you got your rendered map all made up so all you have to do is 
          save it. I saved mine as "Shadow_Layer.tga." You might as well name 
          yours the same way so you see what I am talking about later on in the 
          tutorial.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Lets see if you did this right. Open up your .tga with the Gimp, Photoshop 
        or the photo editing software of your choice. It should be transparent 
        but with shading and dark lines. If you are using the Gimp, it will look 
        something like this: <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <center>
        <img src="model_tutorial_files/009.jpg" height="661" width="559"> 
      </center>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="model_tutorial_files/styleline.gif" height="9" width="400"> </div>
      <h4>Step 6: Rust &amp; Other Fun Stuff</h4>
      <p>More than likely, you did not find steps 2 through 5 extremely exciting. 
        Now you get a chance to flex your artistic muscles. You are going to want 
        to paint all the rust on the 'Mech. So, open up the layer named "Shadow_Layer.tga" 
        and save it as "Rust_Layer.tga" Make sure to uncheck the button that says 
        "RLE Compression" or else TGA Tool 2 will not be able to open it. Now 
        open up "Rust_Layer.tga" with TGA Tool 2 and double click on the alpha 
        channel image in the upper corner. You want to save this image to the 
        desktop and then just close MS Paint. <br>
        <br>
        Open up the one on the desktop with the Gimp and invert the colors. Then, 
        turn the brightness up so you can barely make out the edges. The image 
        should be white but you still want to be able to see it. Save it. <br>
        <br>
        Next, open it with MS Paint and copy it to the clipboard. All you have 
        to do now is paste it into the alpha channel of "Rust_Layer.tga." <br>
        <br>
        Once you have done that, open it up with the Gimp. You should have a hard 
        time seeing the image. Turn off those annoying checkerboards by going 
        to Preferences&gt;Display&gt;Transparency&gt;White Only. Now use your art skills 
        and paint away! <br>
        <br>
        Once you are done, and you made sure that RLE compression is off, save 
        the file. You want to take the alpha channel and remove what is left of 
        the template. To do this, you are going to have to go to Image&gt;Colors&gt;Curves 
        and flatten/cut off the bottom end. The goal is to have the alpha texture 
        all black except for the rusty areas: <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <center>
        <img src="model_tutorial_files/010.jpg" height="512" width="512"> 
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> Photoshop users can skip many of the above steps by displaying 
        the shadow layer as a layer below the rust layer and then deleting it 
        when its served its purpose as a template. I do not use Photoshop so I 
        can not get too specific, though. <br>
        <br>
        However you do it, the goal is to end up with something like this (white 
        = transparent on this image): <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <center>
        <img src="model_tutorial_files/011.jpg" height="611" width="559"> 
      </center>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="model_tutorial_files/styleline.gif" height="9" width="400"> </div>
      <h4>Step 7: Combining The Rust With The Shadows</h4>
      <p>This is so easy it does not even deserve a whole step but what the heck... 
        Basically, you want to stick your rust layer BENEATH your shadow layer. 
        If you have the transparencies correct then you should be able to just 
        open both up and paste the one over the other. Save it as "Shadow+Rust.tga" 
        If all goes well, you will end up with something like this: <br>
        <br>

      <h4>Step 8: Adding Materials, Paint, Windows, etc.</h4>
      <p>This step is rather simple. Use the grayscale image as a template to 
        place the materials on your 'Mech. Anything that you want to be a color, 
        paint it a color. Make sure that two touching panels are not the same 
        color and paint everything else black. Now save it as "Material guide.bmp." 
        <br>
        <br>
        Next, find anything you want to be a solid color and paint it white. If 
        you want some to have a red tint, but not be solid red, paint it grey. 
        Darker is fewer tints while lighter are closer to solid. Save this as 
        "Material alpha.bmp." <br>
        <br>
        Now open "Material guide.bmp" and start painting the pieces the colors 
        you want them to be in game. You can use any method you want such as brushes, 
        textures, solid fill, etc. <br>
        <br>
        All that is left is to combine the colored piece with the alpha channel 
        in TGA Tool 2. Once you are done, you might have something like this: 
        <br>

      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
        Notice the grey areas with the checks showing through. Those areas have 
        a dark grey tint but not solid grey paint. The dark brown area in the 
        upper right is the cockpit. On mine, its color is 38, 19, 2 (RGB). I find 
        it works nicely. </p>

      <h4>Step 9: Merging The Layers</h4>
      <p>What you want to do now is place "Shadow+Rust.tga" on top of your material 
        image. You should get something like this: <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <center>
        <img src="model_tutorial_files/014.jpg" height="609" width="557"> 
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
        If you do not like it, there are several things you can do: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make the shadows more or less visible by lightening or darkening the 
          alpha channel of the shadow + rust layer.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Change the colors on the material layer (I tried 8 different combos 
          before I decided).</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Add or remove rust and other details then recombine the rust and shadow 
          layers.</li>
      </ul>
      <div align="center"><img src="model_tutorial_files/styleline.gif" height="9" width="400"> </div>
      <h4>Step 10: Final Details</h4>
      <p>Just open it up and tweak it if you want. Use a brush and touch up any 
        part that needs it. Then post it, have it reviewed, and be ready to re-do 
        lots of things. I bet I threw out 80% of the work I did on the Stiletto... 
        <br>
        <br>
        You will most likely have to change a few things on the model and texture. 
        The good thing is that your image is a combo of several simpler images 
        so it should be fairly easy to fix. I am just going to show you the final 
        texture you guys are all shooting to obtain in game: <br>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Well, there you have it - The Fireslavish Guide To Modeling. It is by 
        no means the only way and it is unlikely that it is the best way. No two 
        modelers do it exactly the same and you will probably develop a style 
        of your own. Hopefully, this will help you understand the process enough 
        that you will be able to make a 'Mech regardless of the exact steps you 
        follow. Perhaps you can even write down your method for the other newcomers. 
        That is what I did. I figured a noob could explain it to other noobs and 
        keep it fairly understandable. <br>
        <br>
        I hope that other modelers will discover their talents and I hope that 
        our other skilled modelers will not be shy to contribute to this guide 
        or their own guide. Even better, you can now call yourself an "artist," 
        something I would have found incredibly amusing not too long ago considering 
        my pen &amp; paper stick </p>
