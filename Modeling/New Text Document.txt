So, you are going to do modeling for Mechwarrior...
Well it is full of pitfalls, so I created a set of mini-guides to help you out.

The biggest issues:
1. keep the # of vertices per mesh lower than 256...
(That is AFTER TESSELATION AND UNWELDING)
2. Avoid acute angles

Read the attached guide for all the good stuff.

6-4-2009 I have added an EXCELLENT guide to how to make a MECH for mechwarrior by FireSlave from NBT.
There may be some specifics that are different in practice, we will see as things progress
